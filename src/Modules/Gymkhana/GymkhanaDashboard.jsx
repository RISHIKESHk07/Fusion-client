                    The Institute has vibrant Cultural Clubs that provide a
                    platform for students to showcase their creativity and
                    talent. There are six clubs associated with our cultural
                    fraternity, namely: (i) Saaz (Music Club), (ii) Jazbaat
                    (Dramatics Society Club), (iii) Aavartan (Dance Club), (iv)
                    Abhivayakti (Arts & Craft Club), (v) Aakrti (The Film Making
                    & Photography Club), and (vi) Samvaad (Literature & Quizzing
                    Society Club). The activities of the cultural committee are
                    largely student-driven with proper guidance from faculty
                    members. These clubs are active throughout the year. Besides
                    helping students in honing their talent and skills, they
                    organize their respective annual festivals.
